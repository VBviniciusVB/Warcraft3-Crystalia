It's a game created to "Warcraft 3"

This project is OPEN SOURCE but it has some rules using it:
- The project was started by me, so I do not allow the appropriation of more than 30% of the project on any other map without communicating to me and obtaining my permission, otherwise you will be making the appropriation of protected resources, which in this case is illegal.
- You can use the source code wherever you want, but you must remember to credit the person who developed it.
- Do not do anything that contains paid content in updates, this is prohibited in the original game.
